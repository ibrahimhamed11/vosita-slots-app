## Architecture Overview

### Application Structure

The Vosita Slots Management Application follows a modular architecture pattern designed for scalability and maintainability. The application is built using React Native with Expo, leveraging TypeScript for type safety and modern development practices.

#### Core Architecture Principles

**Separation of Concerns**: The application separates business logic, UI components, and data management into distinct layers. This separation ensures that changes in one layer do not directly impact others, making the codebase more maintainable and testable.

**Type Safety**: TypeScript is used throughout the application to provide compile-time type checking, reducing runtime errors and improving developer experience. All interfaces, types, and function signatures are explicitly defined.

**Functional Programming**: The application favors functional programming patterns, using pure functions for data transformations and avoiding side effects where possible. This approach makes the code more predictable and easier to test.

**Component Composition**: React components are designed to be composable and reusable, following the single responsibility principle. Each component has a clear, well-defined purpose.

### Technology Stack Deep Dive

**React Native 0.79.4**: Provides the foundation for cross-platform mobile development, allowing the application to run on both iOS and Android with a single codebase. The latest version includes performance improvements and better TypeScript support.

**Expo SDK 53**: Offers a comprehensive set of tools and services for React Native development, including easy deployment, over-the-air updates, and access to native device features without ejecting from the managed workflow.

**TypeScript 5.8.3**: Enables static type checking, improved IDE support, and better code documentation through type definitions. The latest version includes enhanced type inference and performance improvements.

**Expo Router 5.1.2**: Implements file-based routing similar to Next.js, providing a more intuitive navigation structure and better code organization. This approach makes the navigation hierarchy clear and maintainable.

**Moment.js with Timezone**: Handles complex date and time operations, including timezone conversions and formatting. While Moment.js is in maintenance mode, it remains the most comprehensive solution for timezone handling in React Native applications.

## Component Architecture

### Screen Components

#### SlotsGenerationScreen (`app/(tabs)/index.tsx`)

The Slots Generation Screen serves as the primary interface for configuring slot parameters. This component demonstrates several advanced React Native patterns and best practices.

**State Management**: The component uses React's `useState` hook to manage form state, validation errors, and UI state for date/time pickers. The state is structured to minimize re-renders and maintain data consistency.

```typescript
const [config, setConfig] = useState<SlotConfig>({
  startDate: moment().format('YYYY-MM-DD'),
  endDate: moment().add(5, 'days').format('YYYY-MM-DD'),
  startTime: '10:00',
  endTime: '18:00',
  timeZone: 'America/New_York',
  breakDuration: 15,
  slotDuration: 30,
  bufferDuration: 45,
});
```

**Form Validation**: Real-time validation is implemented using a custom validation system that provides immediate feedback to users. The validation logic is separated into utility functions for reusability and testing.

**Date/Time Handling**: The component integrates with React Native's DateTimePicker component, providing native date and time selection experiences on both iOS and Android platforms. Platform-specific rendering ensures optimal user experience.

**Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling includes both validation errors and runtime exceptions. Error messages are user-friendly and provide clear guidance for resolution.

#### SlotsViewScreen (`app/(tabs)/two.tsx`)

The Slots View Screen implements complex business logic for displaying available slots with timezone conversion and availability filtering.

**Dynamic Filtering**: The component implements real-time filtering of available slots based on current time, buffer duration, and selected timezone. This filtering is performed efficiently using functional programming techniques.

**Timezone Conversion**: Advanced timezone handling allows users to view slots in different timezones while maintaining data integrity. The conversion logic accounts for daylight saving time changes and timezone offset variations.

**List Rendering**: Efficient list rendering using FlatList with proper key extraction and item rendering optimization. The component handles large datasets gracefully with minimal performance impact.

**Pull-to-Refresh**: Implements native pull-to-refresh functionality for updating slot availability, providing a familiar mobile interaction pattern.

### Utility Components

#### Date/Time Pickers

Custom wrapper components around React Native's DateTimePicker provide consistent behavior across platforms while handling platform-specific differences in presentation and interaction.

#### Form Components

Reusable form components with built-in validation and error display capabilities. These components follow accessibility guidelines and provide proper keyboard navigation support.

## Type System

### Core Interfaces

The application's type system is designed to provide comprehensive type safety while remaining flexible for future enhancements.

#### SlotConfig Interface

```typescript
export interface SlotConfig {
  startDate: string; // YYYY-MM-DD format
  endDate: string; // YYYY-MM-DD format
  startTime: string; // HH:mm format
  endTime: string; // HH:mm format
  timeZone: string; // timezone identifier
  breakDuration: number; // minutes
  slotDuration: number; // minutes
  bufferDuration: number; // minutes
}
```

This interface defines the configuration parameters for slot generation. Each field includes specific format requirements and validation constraints.

#### Slot Interface

```typescript
export interface Slot {
  id: string;
  startTime: Date;
  endTime: Date;
  timeZone: string;
  isAvailable: boolean;
}
```

The Slot interface represents individual appointment slots with all necessary information for display and booking logic.

#### ValidationError Interface

```typescript
export interface ValidationError {
  field: string;
  message: string;
}
```

Provides structured error information for form validation, enabling targeted error display and user guidance.

### Type Guards and Utilities

The application implements type guards and utility types to ensure runtime type safety and provide better developer experience.

**Timezone Validation**: Custom type guards validate timezone identifiers against the Moment.js timezone database, preventing runtime errors from invalid timezone strings.

**Date Format Validation**: Strict date and time format validation ensures data consistency and prevents parsing errors.

## Utility Functions

### Slot Generation (`utils/slotGenerator.ts`)

The slot generation utility contains the core business logic for creating appointment slots based on configuration parameters.

#### Validation System

```typescript
export function validateSlotConfig(config: SlotConfig): ValidationError[]
```

Comprehensive validation function that checks all configuration parameters for validity and logical consistency. The validation includes:

- **Date Format Validation**: Ensures dates are in YYYY-MM-DD format and represent valid calendar dates
- **Date Range Validation**: Verifies that end date is after or equal to start date
- **Time Format Validation**: Checks that times are in HH:mm format and represent valid times
- **Time Range Validation**: Ensures end time is after start time
- **Duration Validation**: Validates that all duration values are positive numbers
- **Timezone Validation**: Verifies timezone identifiers against the Moment.js timezone database

#### Slot Generation Algorithm

```typescript
export function generateSlots(config: SlotConfig): Slot[]
```

The slot generation algorithm implements the following logic:

1. **Date Range Iteration**: Iterates through each day in the specified date range
2. **Daily Slot Calculation**: For each day, calculates slots between start and end times
3. **Slot Timing**: Creates slots with specified duration and break intervals
4. **Timezone Application**: Applies the selected timezone to all generated slots
5. **Unique Identification**: Generates unique IDs for each slot based on timestamp and timezone

The algorithm handles edge cases such as:
- Days where the time range doesn't accommodate any complete slots
- Timezone transitions during daylight saving time changes
- Leap years and month boundaries

#### Availability Calculation

```typescript
export function getAvailableSlots(
  slots: Slot[],
  currentTime: Date,
  bufferDuration: number,
  selectedTimeZone?: string
): Slot[]
```

Advanced availability calculation that considers:
- Current time and buffer duration requirements
- Timezone conversions for display purposes
- Slot booking status (extensible for future booking functionality)

### Date/Time Utilities

Additional utility functions handle common date and time operations:

**Formatting Functions**: Consistent date and time formatting across the application
**Timezone Conversion**: Safe timezone conversion with error handling
**Relative Time Calculation**: Functions for calculating time differences and relative dates

## State Management

### Local State Strategy

The application currently uses React's built-in state management (useState, useEffect) for simplicity and performance. This approach is suitable for the current scope but can be extended with more sophisticated state management solutions as the application grows.

#### State Structure

**Component-Level State**: Each screen manages its own state for UI interactions and form data. This approach provides good encapsulation and prevents unnecessary re-renders.

**Derived State**: Calculated values (such as available slots) are derived from base state using useMemo and useEffect hooks, ensuring efficient updates and preventing unnecessary recalculations.

#### State Persistence

Currently, the application doesn't persist state between sessions. For production use, consider implementing:
- AsyncStorage for user preferences
- Secure storage for sensitive configuration data
- Cache management for generated slots

### Future State Management Considerations

For larger applications, consider implementing:

**Redux Toolkit**: For complex state management with time-travel debugging
**Zustand**: Lightweight state management with minimal boilerplate
**React Query**: For server state management and caching
**Recoil**: For fine-grained reactive state management

## Navigation Structure

### Expo Router Implementation

The application uses Expo Router for navigation, providing a file-based routing system that's intuitive and maintainable.

#### Route Structure

```
app/
├── _layout.tsx          # Root layout with navigation setup
├── (tabs)/              # Tab-based navigation group
│   ├── _layout.tsx      # Tab layout configuration
│   ├── index.tsx        # Slots Generation Screen
│   ├── SlotsViewScreen.tsx          # Slots View Screen
```

## Deep Linking Usage

### Overview

The Vosita Slots Management Application supports deep linking to navigate directly to the Slots View screen with a pre-selected time zone. This works on both native (iOS/Android) and web platforms.

**Implementation Note:**  
The deep linking logic is handled in the `useSlotsViewLogic` hook (`hooks/useSlotsViewLogic.ts`).  
- The hook accepts an optional `initialTimezone` parameter.
- When the Slots View screen is opened via a deep link (e.g., `/slots-view?timezone=America/New_York`), the screen extracts the `timezone` query parameter and passes it as `initialTimezone` to the hook.
- The hook then uses this value to set the initial selected timezone for slot display and filtering.

### Deep Linking Configuration

The app uses the `scheme` defined in `app.json` for native deep linking.  
**Current scheme:** `vositaslotsapp`

To update the scheme, edit the `scheme` property in `app.json`:

```json
{
  "expo": {
    "scheme": "vositaslotsapp",
    "deepLinks": [
      {
        "path": "slots-view",
        "queryParams": {
          "timezone": "string"
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

### Deep Link Format

- **Native (iOS/Android):**
  ```
  vositaslotsapp://slots-view?timezone=America/New_York
  ```

- **Web:**
  ```
  https://your-app-domain.com/slots-view?timezone=America/New_York
  ```

### How It Works

- The `timezone` query parameter is read from the URL.
- If provided and valid, the Slots View screen will open with the specified time zone selected.
- The `useSlotsViewLogic` hook receives this value as `initialTimezone` and applies it as the initial timezone for the session.

### Testing Deep Linking

#### On Web

1. Run the app with `npx expo start --web`.
2. Open your browser and navigate to:
   ```
   http://localhost:8081/slots-view?timezone=America/Chicago
   ```
   (Adjust the port if needed.)

#### On iOS Simulator

1. Open the iOS simulator.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   xcrun simctl openurl booted vositaslotsapp://slots-view?timezone=America/Chicago
   ```

#### On Android Emulator

1. Open the Android emulator.
2. Run the following command in your terminal:
   ```
   adb shell am start -a android.intent.action.VIEW -d "vositaslotsapp://slots-view?timezone=America/Chicago"
   ```

### Updating and Testing Configuration

To ensure deep linking works correctly:

1. Update the `scheme` in `app.json` if necessary.
2. Test the deep linking functionality on all supported platforms (web, iOS, Android).
3. Verify that the `timezone` parameter is correctly parsed and applied in the Slots View screen.
